Second Demo
Broker Pattern
In this second Demo, the Broker Pattern is used, which constitutes a middle man (broker) between a typical communications between parties. As these parties grow in size and one party starts demanding more lines of communication, the cluster in the middle can become chaotic and unmanageable. Hence the need for the Broker Pattern which regulates the exchange in the middle, by identifying what the sender is sending and what the receiver is waiting for.
     The App Demo I prepared is a very basic and simple broker implementation, by basically avoiding any of the source (publisher) and receiver (subscriber) parties and going straight to the middle man (broker component) logic. The Demo is what I hope to be the most basic of brokers, including a publisher, subscriber and Unsubscribe methods.
